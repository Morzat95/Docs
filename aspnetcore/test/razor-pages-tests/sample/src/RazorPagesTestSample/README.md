# ASP.NET Core Razor Pages unit and integration testing sample

This sample illustrates unit and integration testing of a [Razor Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/razor-pages) app. This sample demonstrates the features described in the [Razor Pages unit and integration tests](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/test/razor-pages-tests) topic.

If you aren't using an IDE with built-in testing features, execute the following command at a command prompt in the *tests/RazorPagesTestSample.Tests* folder:

```console
dotnet test
```
